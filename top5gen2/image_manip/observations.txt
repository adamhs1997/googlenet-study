Fridge:
CAN block out some of the parts that are ignored in the image segment files and get same if not better results
CANNOT input the segment file as it picks up on the blockiness and looks at it as more of a crossword or maze
Blocking with white gives higher confidences (though this may just be for fridge image where white matters)
Seems that the images will peak in confidence after block out too much
--Same holds for black and white, though less so for white (at least for fridge)
Can block out main stuff, but with fridge, get much less loss if use white i/o black

Sharpener:
Black also more destructive than white in terms of confidence
Seems it can get by without seeing screw, despite what output interests file says
Can identify without screw or hole, but much harder
--Oddly, black seems better; poss. because sharpener is black
Cutting edges will throw prediction entirely
--Oddly, white seems less intrusive, even on black sharpener
--Blacking out main parts had better results than edges; whiting out edges was better than main parts

Colobus:
Blocking out with black around the image actually improves the confidence
--Adding more black decreases conf
White blocking yields same final conf for colobus output
--Adding more white increases conf
Blocking out eyes seems to greatly decrease the conf, esp if done with white
Cutting white fur really decreases prob of colobus--black or white brings up other monkeys
