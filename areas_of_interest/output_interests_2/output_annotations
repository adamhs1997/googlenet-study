  ** NOTE: These are based on the 50% threshold images **
 
 Barn:
 --Seems to look mostly at wood-ness of barn and metal roof
 --Looks at peak of roof (especially in img 5)
 --Looks for general barn shape (slanted roof, flat wood sides, etc.)
 --May also look at doorways
 
 Dams:
 --Looks at mostly falling water, mist
 --Gets at edges of dam structure
 --Looks at low and high part of falling water, seems to miss middle
 --Ignores large parts of middle of structure of Dams
 
 Fridge:
 --If open, seems to pick up shelves for most part, but also hits on food inside
 --If closed, picks up on edges of doors/drawers--largely misses middle
 --Seems drawn to "white" areas representing shelves, "black" areas of space between
 
 Gas Pump:
 --Very clearly drawn to the price dials on the pump (digital or analog)
 --Also picks up on the hoses around pump
 --Seems not so much to care about shape of pump rather than standard pump features
 
 Mashed Potato:
 --Looks at edges of potato pile and the container they are in (typically a round bowl/plate)
 --Tends to pick up areas of contrast (light/dark) within potato, iindicating a pile type setting
 --Ignores surroundings, other foods for most part (though having excessive amounts of other food changes conf)

 --Gets some bits of water underneath, but does not seem to be critical factor
